ControlMe
=========

This is a simple program to remotly control other computers from a main computer/server


To use the ControlMe open both client and server.
After using client it will ask you to enter server's IP. If you want to test it in your
computer just enter "127.0.0.1". It's the IP of localhost.
Then you can type any message you want and see it in server.
